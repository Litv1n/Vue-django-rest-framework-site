### About porject
This frontend part of the project takes posts model from django-rest-framework project made by me.
I deployed DRF project on the Heroku - https://young-garden-17464.herokuapp.com/api/posts/ and frontend part takes posts from the backend part.
Also, I made pages without reload with the help of Vue router. Final site - https://withered-firefly-7020.herokuapp.com/ is deployed on the Heroku.
